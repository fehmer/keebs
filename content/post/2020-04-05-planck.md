## Highlights

Back in 2017 I watched [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YyoB9rEzOeY) and [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKGXZ1ReU54) youtube video and was intrigued and terrified by the concept. But I liked the 60% form factor a lot and am into optimising my workflows I finally gave the planck a shot in late 2018 and ordered a rev6 hot-swappable PCB which arrived in april 2019. Still it took me a while to finally "build" this keyboard and try it out. 

The first attempt with the default layout and function layers was really bad and I abondoned the keyboard for another couple of month. I finally got time and interest to design my own layouts and try it one more time with Kalih Box Jade switches. And I loved it. After a few tweaks to the layout its intuitive for me and it replaced my previous [daily driver](/post/2020-04-04-custom-sixty/) after two days.

In 2020 I replaced the Zealios V1 65g with Zilents V2 65g and the XDA Canvas Betas + Icon Mods keycaps with MT3 Susuwatari.

In 2022 I replaced the switches with Boba 4Ut and the keycaps with SA Laser.

## Layouts


Layout for me was the major reason not to use the Planck at first. The default layout might be usable for others but I was not able to use it because it felt just "wrong". 

I defined the layout in a logical/natural layout in my opinion and only needed minor tweaks with the `?` and `=` keys and the german "umlaute".
