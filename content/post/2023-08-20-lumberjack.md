Building the [Piet](/post/2022-05-21-lumberjack-piet) was fun, but I cannot get up to speed with it. I don't know if it is the unusual switches or the flat keycaps. But I do enjoy the layout, so I build another one with more familiar switches and keycaps.

## Highlights

My second [THT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Through-hole_technology) build. I really enjoy soldering it together. Designing and building a hand-wired keyboard (like my C64 themed [Planck64](/post/2020-04-06-planck64/) or the [Atreus 62](/post/2020-07-18-atreus62/)) is a lot of work. Especially soldering all the wires and getting the firmware set up. THT is a great alternative as soldering the switches to the PCB is easier and the firmware already exists.

This is the first time I used [Mill Max Sockets](https://www.mill-max.com/products/new/pcb-sockets-and-micro-plugs) to make a non-hot-swappable PCB hot-swappable. I used a sacrificial switch to get the alignments right. It was quite an easy job, I only messed up two sockets soldering the switch to the socket.

## Layouts

Similar to [first planck](/post/2020-04-05-planck/#layouts) but with some additional keys mapped on the first row.
