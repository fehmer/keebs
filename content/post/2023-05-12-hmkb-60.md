I really enjoy industrial design and heavy keyboards. While the group buy for the HMKB was running I didn't pull the trigger because I had other outstanding GBs. Luckily there were some extras left when it finally finished in 2023.

## Highlights

Another lumberjack PCB, this time in the HMKB 60 case. The HMKB 60 does not support the lumberjack layout, so I had to had to copy and paste together my own plate files and order it to be manufactured. Luckily both, the creator of the lumberjack and the folks at HMKB released their plate files. I used Mill-Max sockets again to create a hot-swappable PCB.
