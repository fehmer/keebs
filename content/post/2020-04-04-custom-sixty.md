## Highlights

In 2015 the [Ducky YotH](/post/2020-04-02-ducky-yoth/) was my daily driver. After switching from MX Browns to MX Blues I still was not very happy with the weight of the switches and decided to build my custom keyboard. I wanted to keep the 60% form factor I really enjoyed but wanted to find more heavy tactile switches (I don't like the high pitched click of the cherries and wanted to be able to use the keyboard in an office environment).

I bought Zealios V1 65g which seemed like a good tactile switch and combined it with a Satan 60, a wodden casing and a black aluminium backplate. I re-used the black and white keycaps from my Filco Majestouch. To improve the weight of the keyboard I added an additional 2mm steel backplate inside the wodden case.

In 2016 I replaced the keycaps with SA 1976 which are still my favourite keycap set.

In 2019 I updated the keyboard with a DZ60 PCB, Zealios V2 65g and a brass switch plate.
