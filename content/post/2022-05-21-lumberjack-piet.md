I looked for a 40-ish percent through-hole kit for a while. I really like the look of the exposed components with a nice and tidy layout. At the same time the stacked or even missing case I don't like very much. Especially with some kits costing a lot (on their own and especially with taxes and shipping from the us). 

There is some really nice stuff from e.g. mechwild like the [Mercutio](https://mechwild.com/product/mercutio/), the [Romeo](https://github.com/coseyfannitutti/romeo) and the [0xCB Static](https://candykeys.com/product/0xcb-static-keyboard-kit). But, again, too pricey for me considering the case. There is a nicer board, the [Argyle](https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=106255.0). But it uses a staggered 60% layout and I do have enough boards with that (for now ðŸ˜„).

In early 2021 I missed the first round of the [Lumberjack](https://github.com/peej/lumberjack-keyboard). I joined the R2 and directly bought three different colours. With a price of 22â‚¬ plus affordable shipping from the Netherlands this is a great deal. You get the PCB, all needed components and the FR4 plate. The PCB should be compatible with a wide variety of 60% cases, in addition it supports MX, Alps and Kalih Choc switches.

## Highlights

This keyboard is meant to be a fun and unique project, so I went all-in and tried to do things different then normal. So instead of using tactile switches and high-profile keycaps I picked linear low-profile choc switches with matching low-profile keycaps. Since there is a very limited offer for such keycaps I had to get creative to avoid the typical all-white or all-black, no legends low profile look. With the lumberjack already having its roots in the Netherlands it feels appropriate to imitate the art of Piet Mondrian. Did you know there is a [programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esoteric_programming_language#Piet) named after him?

Similar to [first planck](/post/2020-04-05-planck/#layouts) but with some additional keys mapped on the first row.
