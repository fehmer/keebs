## Highlights

I ordered this keyboard end of 2020 after giving up on a group buy I joined a long time ago with a similar style keyboard. While waiting on this GB to complete I switched to ortho layouts. Fortunately there were still some extras available so I ordered [another one](/post/2022-06-05-saturn-60o) with an ortholinear layout. My girlfriend happily took over this one.
