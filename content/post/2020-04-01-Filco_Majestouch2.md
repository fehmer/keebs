My first modern mechanical keyboard. After my [modelf](/post/2020-04-03-ibm-5150-model-f-xt/) was not longer usable with "newer" PCs I used membrane keyboards and scissor switches for quite a while. With money to spare from my first job I started my journey into mechanical keyboard with the usual full size keyboard with Cherry MX Brown switches. 

Much later, already deeper in the hobby, I replaced the controller with bathroom epiphanies [The Tiger Lily](http://bathroomepiphanies.com/controllers/), leaving only my [ducky keyboard](/post/2020-04-02-ducky-yoth/) as non-programmable keyboard behind. In 2021 I [added](https://github.com/the-via/keyboards/pull/646) VIA support for it.
