My second hand-wired keyboard is a clone of the Atreus with 62 keys. Building my [first hand-wired keyboard](https://keebs.fehmer.info/post/2020-04-06-planck64/) was so much fun and I had Zealios V1 laying around so I built another one.

## Facts

| **Manufacture Date** | April-June 2020 |
| **Case** | Handbuild, oiled oak with brass inlay |
| **Plate** | Custom designed, CNC milled 3mm stainless steel |
| **Switches** | Zealios V1 65g |
| **Keycaps** | SA Laser alphas + Ortho Minicons|
| **Dimensions** | 345 × 270 × 22 mm |
| **Weight** | 2140 gram |

## Layouts

The layout is kind of a hybrid of the layout I use with my [Planck](https://keebs.fehmer.info/post/2020-04-05-planck/#layouts) with the additional number row. I switched the "thumb keys" around back and forward between having `space` on the 1.5u or the inner most 1u key. I ended up with using the 1u as `space` and the 1.5u as second `return` and `backspace`.

## Firmware

I am using QMK with this [config](https://github.com/fehmer/qmk_firmware/tree/fehmer/keyboards/handwired/atreus62/keymaps/fehmer).

### The case

Based on a 22mm oak slab I used my hand-router for the  cutout of ~3mm matching exactly the steel plate and a deeper ~15mm cutout with an 2mm inset of the plate shape, giving it a nice ridge to sit on. Unfortunately with the high of the inner cutout I was not able to add an USB connector so I had to attach the cable fixed. I added an aviator 5-pin connector to have it somewhat detachable.

On the backside there is an additional cutout under the wrist rest for the brass weight of around 750gram. I glued in seven brass screw sockets and used pcb spacers to attach the plate to the case. 

I finished the case by rounding of the edges, sanding the wood up to 320 grid and oiling it.

### Wiring

With the curvature of the rows the wiring looks less clean as the one on the [Planck 64](https://keebs.fehmer.info/post/2020-04-06-planck64/#wiring). Overall I uses the same materials and techniques as on the Planck64. At the bottom I added a magnetic reed switch to reset the board in case I mess up the firmware.
